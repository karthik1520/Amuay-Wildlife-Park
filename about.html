                <h3 style="margin-bottom: 10px;"> Conservation and Preservation at Amuay Wildlife Park </h3>
                <p>
                    At Amuay Wildlife Park, nestled 350 km west of the bustling Venezuelan capital, 
                    we are committed to safeguarding the rich biodiversity of Venezuela and fostering 
                    a deep appreciation for nature among our visitors. Our mission revolves around promoting 
                    conservation, preservation, and sustainable practices to ensure the well-being of our 
                    wildlife and their habitats.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many of our residents at Amuay Wildlife Park have been victims of exploitation and abuse, 
                    rescued from laboratories, circuses, roadside zoos, and the illegal pet trade. 
                    We offer them sanctuary, providing tailored care and rehabilitation to help them recover 
                    physically and mentally. Our dedicated team of animal keepers, zoologists, veterinarians, 
                    and international consultants ensures that each animal receives the highest standard of care.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While release into the wild may not be feasible for some animals, we provide them with natural 
                    habitats that mimic their wild environment as closely as possible. Through environmental enrichment 
                    and species-specific care, we encourage natural behaviors and instincts, allowing our residents to 
                    flourish in their new home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Education is a cornerstone of our mission at Amuay Wildlife Park. We offer immersive educational tours 
                    and interactive activities designed to spark curiosity and ignite imaginations. From guided nature walks 
                    to arts and crafts workshops, children have the opportunity to learn about Venezuela's rich biodiversity 
                    and the importance of wildlife conservation in a fun and engaging way.
                </p>
                <p>
